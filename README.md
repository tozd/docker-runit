# tozd/runit

<https://gitlab.com/tozd/docker/runit>

An image using [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/) for service supervision.

It can serve as a good base image for other Docker images.

In short, to create a service create `/etc/service/<name>/run` script which at the end
`exec`s into the service executable you want to run (and supervise to keep running).
